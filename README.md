		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>Hi, so my name is Mkhanyisi Abia Christopher Mama. I'm 21yrs old, I reside in Langa which is in Cape Town, South Africa. I go by many names as some people can't pronounce my name properly, so hence when I'm in different areas around South Africa people call me by a nickname they've assigned to themselves.</p>

		<h3>Goals</h3>
		<p>
			My goals in life are quite simple, yet at the same time quite challenging in life. I want to live my life according to the hashtag that I created for myself, #Let'sBeDifferent which exactly means that because, I believe that you as a person are supposed to live your life the way you want to live no matter what.
